#Customer Behavior Analysis and Revenue Insights for a Retail Business: A Data-Driven Approach.

This work is a detailed data analysis project that focuses on customer behavior and revenue analysis for a retail business. It involves various steps to clean the data, extract relevant features, analyze customer behavior, calculate customer lifetime value, remove outliers, and explore revenue patterns. The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into customer segments, understand their purchasing patterns, identify high-value customers, and explore revenue trends by different factors such as country, month, and day of the week.



Data cleaning is an essential first step in any data analysis project. In this work, the data is loaded from a CSV file, and missing values are identified and removed. By removing missing values, we ensure the data is accurate and reliable for further analysis.

Feature extraction is performed to derive additional meaningful information from the existing data. Various features such as day, month, year, hour, and minute are extracted from the InvoiceDate column, providing a more granular view of time-related patterns. The total price is calculated by multiplying the quantity and unit price, giving us insights into the monetary value of each transaction. Additionally, the length of the description column is extracted, which can be used as a feature in the analysis.

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a widely used technique in marketing and customer relationship management. It helps segment customers based on their behavior and purchase patterns. In this work, RFM metrics are calculated for each customer using the summarise function and grouping the data by customer. The RFM scores are then calculated by dividing customers into quartiles based on their RFM metrics. By combining the RFM scores, RFM segments are created, providing a comprehensive view of customer segments based on their recency, frequency, and monetary value. These segments can be used to target specific groups of customers with tailored marketing strategies. The work also calculates summary statistics for each RFM segment, such as mean recency, median frequency, and mean monetary value, providing further insights into customer behavior.

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a metric that estimates the total value a customer brings to a business over their entire relationship. In this work, CLV is calculated by considering the average order value, purchase frequency, and an average customer lifespan (e.g., 3 years). This metric helps identify high-value customers who contribute significantly to the business's revenue. By sorting the CLV data in descending order, the work identifies the most valuable customers and allows the business to focus its resources on retaining and nurturing these customers.

Outlier removal is an important step to ensure the analysis is not skewed by extreme values. In this work, outliers in the TotalPrice column are visualized using a box plot and a histogram. Z-scores are then calculated to identify values that deviate significantly from the mean. A threshold is defined for outliers (e.g., z-score > 3 or < -3), and the data is filtered to remove these outliers based on their z-scores. This ensures that the subsequent analysis and visualizations are based on reliable and representative data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to explore revenue patterns by different factors. Revenue by country is calculated by grouping the data by country and summing the total revenue, providing insights into the geographic distribution of revenue. Revenue by month and day of the week is also analyzed, allowing the identification of seasonal or weekly patterns in revenue. Bar plots and colorful visualizations are created to present these revenue patterns in an easily understandable format.

The relevance of this work lies in its ability to provide actionable insights for the retail business. By analyzing customer behavior and segmenting customers based on RFM metrics, the business can tailor marketing strategies and offerings to different customer groups. Understanding customer lifetime value helps in identifying and retaining high-value customers, resulting in increased revenue and customer loyalty. The removal of outliers ensures that the analysis is based on reliable data, leading to more accurate insights. Exploring revenue patterns by different factors provides a deeper understanding of the business's performance and helps identify areas for improvement or targeted marketing campaigns.

Overall, this work combines various analytical techniques and visualizations to provide a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior, revenue patterns, and customer value for the retail business. The insights gained from this analysis can inform strategic decision-making, marketing campaigns, and customer relationship management, leading to improved business performance and profitability.
